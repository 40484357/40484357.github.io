<p>
Welcome to the website for the Web Tech Module at Edinburgh Napier University. In this module we'll focus on the tools and technologies involved in the client side of the web, that is everything that happens in the browser.

Many of us will already have experienced some aspect of all of the topics covered in this module. Partly because it is really difficult to engage in modern life without using the web in some capacity and thereby being exposed to the end user experience of being a web user, partly because some aspects of HTML, CSS, and Javascript are taught at various levels throughout school and college as an easy way into technology and coding skills, and partly because the web and it’s various technologies are quite accessible. It is quite easy to throw some HTML at a web browser and see the results without needing to deal with the compilers and development environments that most other programming tasks require.

In this module we’re going to break down our existing web skills, fill in any gaps we identify, and then reassemble everything into a robust and extensible toolkit for building, using, and exploiting web-based technologies. We will mostly focus on the client side, developing strong skills for designing and implementing web sites & web applications that run in the user’s web browser. We'll supplement this with a look at Browser APIs and Web APIs. We’ll support these skills with knowledge of design and development methodologies that enable us to document and communicate our ideas to others, as well as a practical understanding of the web standards and  accessibility considerations that underpin professional operation in this area. Finally, we'll consider what's involved in deploying & serving our websites and what it means for a site to be "web scale".

This module lays the groundwork for SET09103 "Advanced Web Tech" which switched focus from the client to the server and explores how to dynamically create web sites & content.

<p> Where possible, I'll try to make lecture slide available in plenty of time before the actual lecture. 
However, I am revising these slides to include new and relevant materials so there may be a constant 
process of updates and revisions during the trimester.</p>

these are undergoing revision and improvement so might be altered & updated at short notice.</p>

<p>The core text for this module</p>
<br>
<p> The University Library has subscriptions to a heap of online resources. 
The following books are the core texts for this module this year and are available for download 
(in PDF or EPUB formats) using your Napier credentials:</p>
<ul class = "pdfs">
<li><a href = "/introducing/"> Introducing Web Development </a></li>
<li><a href = "/practicals/">Practical Web Design for Absolute Beginners</a></li>
<li><a href = "/resposnive/">Moving to responsive Web Design</a></li>
<li><a href = "/responsive2/">Beginning Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS3</a></li>
<li><a href = "/sustain/">Sustainable Web Ecosystem Design</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The library also has a lot of books on web development & related technologies.
 You should supplement the suggested reading above with books and other resources that you find for yourself. 
 This is part of the university experience, taking the suggested readings and topics covered during lectures and labs, using them as a basic scaffold, 
then diving deeply into related topics in order to extend your knowledge and in order to tailor your learning and skillset to your own interests and career plans.
