<h1>Growing Tips</h1>
<h2>Growing chillies indoors in Scotland</h2></hgroup>
<h3>Keep the roots warm</h3>
<p>When growing your chillies indoors in Scotland, it's important to let your chillies dehydrate a little. 
	Water them when the pots are a lot lighter and the leaves start to droop.
		Chillies are used to very warm conditions and their roots like to be warm, by dehydrating them you keep them warm</p>
		
<br>
<h3>Water from the bottom</h3>
<p>It's not always possible, but when it is, water the plants from the bottom. This will prevent drowning them and the soil soaks up what it can.
	It will also stop pools of water forming on top of the soil which prevents fruit flies and other insects being attracted to the soil</p>

<h3>Feed them</h3>
<p>Pay attention to your plants, look at their branches and stem, they communicate themselves and sometimes it's worth putting a little extra feed mixed with the watering.
	I feed my plants every watering even in Winter. What the plants don't eat, the soil absorbs or rejects, it will keep the soil rich and nutritious for the spring and summer growing

<h1>My Plants</h1>

<h3 id="BelgianC">Belgian Carrots</h3>
<p>The Belgian Carrot is a bright orange chillie that grows well in colder weather. It is easy to maintain and not very demanding.
	It will provide beautiful, big fruits, that are hot but also fruity and sweet. Perfect for Stews, and soups.</p>

<h3 id="BirdsEye">Birds Eye</h3>
<p> You may be more familiar with this chillies sibling the Peri Peri chillie made more famous by Nandos. 
	The Birds Eye is the more Scottish friendly chillie. The little red dynamites pack one hell of a punch and grow well in cold weather.
		I would reccomend placing it somewhere with a lot of light and more warmth as it's not totally adept to the cold climates</p>
		
<h3 id="OmniColour">OmniColour</h3>
<p> The Aji OmniColour is a big bush of tons of chillies. It is probably my biggest plant in terms of volume and produces some potent chillies. 
	The plant also benefits from a sun heavy spot with warmth, it sits on our radiator. The plant grows wide and takes up a lot of space but it produces a lot of fruit.
	</p>

<h3 id ="PeterPepper">Peter Pepper</h3>
<p> These funny looking chillies grow wonderfully. One of ours is big, growing like a bonsai tree of sorts. 
	It produces a decent amount of fruit that are big and packed with flavour and heat</p>

<h3 id="Tabasco">Tabasco</h3>
<p> This is a tough one to grow in Scotland, it really struggles in the winter months where there is very little light and heat. 
	It is big but not quite big enough for a stand alone tub(pot). A hard one that is quite needy especially in winter</p>
