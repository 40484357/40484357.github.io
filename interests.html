	<h1> Interests </h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Programming</li>
		<p> What started as a hobby, has slowly become a profession. Still in the early stages, I am excited to see where I go with this</p>
		<li>Football</li>
		<p> A supporter of Arsenal, I love all things football. I pay close attention to stastics and try to understand footballing statistics of all players and teams in context</p>
		<br>
		<p> I hope to one day be able to tie in Football and programming but I have a lot of ideas</p>
		<li><a href="chillies.html">Chillies</a></li>
		<p>I grow 7 Chilli plants in my home at the moment, I plan on expanding my range</p>
		<li>Cricket</li>
		<p> I could just put in sport, as I also hold rugby as an interest, but Cricket and Football are my two loves in the sporting world.</p>
		<br>
		<p> The slow chess-like environment of cricket has always been a passion for me, a great distraction and background noise. The statistics again in cricket are always fascinating</p>
		<br>
		<li>Crypto currency</li>
		<p> A new interest and one taking the world by storm. I try to understand the complexities and use cases for Crypto, I think there are a lot and I enjoy keeping an eye on upcoming trends.</p>
		<br>
		<li>Cooking and Food</li>
		<p> The two go hand-in-hand. I love both, it's exciting creative and provides on of lifes greatest experiences.</p>
		<br>
		<li>Sustainability</li>
		<p> Although I believe big corporations are the biggest contributors to the unsastainable nature mass porduction. Consumers also greatly contribute to these destructive practices</p>
		<br>
		<p> I believe technology and programming can make sustainable practices easier to follow and there is a vast and growing space for technology to aid in improving sustainability</p>
		<br>
		<li>Photonics</li>
		<p> My partner works is a Research associate in Photonics. I enjoy learning about it from her, and although I wouldn't call it a direct interest, it is fascinating to learn about and has developed a profound understanding and appreciation for Physics</p>
